# A-study-on-Bayesian-Neural-Networks-on-simple-binary-and-multiclass-classification

Two different comparisons were done on a binary and multiclass classification tasks between classical neural network approach and a bayesian neural network one. 

The probabilistic models were implemented using PyMC 2.x with MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)
